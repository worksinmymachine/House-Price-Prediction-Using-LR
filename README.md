# House Price Prediction Mini Project

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Mini Project! This project aims to predict house prices using a simple linear regression model. The dataset used for building this model is provided in the `Data.csv` file.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on certain features. The goal is to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable (house prices) and make accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `Data.csv`. It contains the following columns:

- `bedrooms`: number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: number of bathrooms
- `sqft_living`: area of the living room ..etc
- `Price`: The target variable representing the house price

## Files in the Repository

- `Data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `House_price_prediction_LR.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file (if available) or install them manually. Typical dependencies include `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook to explore and run the code:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook House_price_prediction_LR.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

The Jupyter notebook `House_price_prediction_LR.ipynb` contains the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and prepare the data for modeling.
2. **Model Training**: Train a simple linear regression model using the dataset.
3. **Todo: Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. 
4. **Predictions**: Make predictions using the trained model and visualize the results.
